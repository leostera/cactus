# Archimedean Oath

Considering the life of Archimedes of Syracuse who illustrated the ambiguous
potential of technology since the Antiquity,

Considering the growing responsibility of engineers and scientists towards
humans and nature,

Considering the importance of the ethical problems stemming from technology and
its applications,

Today, I commit to the following statements and shall endeavor to reach towards
the ideal that they represent:

1. I shall practice for the good of mankind, respecting human rights and the
   environment.

1. I shall recognize the responsibility for my actions, after informing myself
   to the best of my abilities, and shall in no case discharge my
   responsibilities on another person.

1. I shall endeavor to perfect my professional abilities.

1. When choosing and implementing projects, I shall remain wary of their
   context and their consequences, notably in their technical, economic, social
   and ecological aspects. I shall give particular attention to projects with
   military applications.

1. I shall contribute, to the extent of my abilities, to promote equitable
   relationships between humans and to support the development of economically
   weaker countries.

1. I shall transmit, with rigor and honesty, to discerningly chosen
   interlocutors, any important information, if it constitutes a gain for
   society or if its retention constitutes a danger for others. In the latter
   case, I shall ensure that the communication yields concrete action.  I shall
   not let myself be governed by the defense of my own interests or those of my
   corporation.

1. I shall endeavor, to the best of my abilities, to lead my company to take
   into account the preoccupations of the present oath.

1. I shall practice my profession in complete intellectual honesty, with
   conscience and dignity.

I solemnly take this oath, freely and on my honor.
